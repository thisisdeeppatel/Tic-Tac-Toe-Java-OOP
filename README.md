## Info:
The Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a command-line-based application that allows users to play against the computer. The game follows the classic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their symbol ('X' or 'O').
